            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the only captain in cricket history to win all three major ICC tournaments: the ICC T20 World Cup (2007), the ICC Cricket World Cup (2011), and the ICC Champions Trophy (2013). He captained India in 332 international matches, the most by any captain, and led India to the No. 1 Test ranking in 2009. Dhoni has scored over 10,000 runs in ODIs with an average above 50 and is regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), he has led Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to 5 titles (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023) and multiple playoff appearances, making CSK one of the most consistent teams. He was also honored with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (2007), Padma Shri (2009), and Padma Bhushan (2018) for his contributions to Indian cricket.</p>
